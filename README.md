# Bayesian Tutorials
This repo hosts code behind the series of blog posts on [stablemarkets.wordpress.com](https://stablemarkets.wordpress.com) that walk through MCMC implementations for various classes of Bayesian models. I wrote these in grad school as I was teaching myself Bayesian computation. I never felt like I truly understood something until I could implement it from scratch. The code is probably all very inefficient and perhaps even wrong, but is a kind of diary of my "from scratch" journey learning Bayes.
